NodeJS Music player app.

Parses the local music directory for mp3 files. No templating engine cuz I find that tedious. Simple jQuery AJAX FTW! 
test.js is the main router and is routed to by index.js. The code is commented where required and it is quite easy to follow. You don't have to be a vetran JS programmer to understand it.

Used waveform.js to generate waveforms as seen in SoundCloud. Basic functionality like seek, play/pause, shuffle etc are present.
